        <p> The reccomended time to see the Northern Lights is when it's winterr, between September and April, because that is usually when the dim dark and endless nights have taken over from the bright summernights in Iceland. The Northern lights are said to be most visible during the equinoxes which take place usually in September and March. it would honestly just simply gives you a larger window each day to witness them.
